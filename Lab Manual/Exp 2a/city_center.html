                <p1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you stand in the middle of Corpo Plaza and observe what's around 
                    you - all the breathtaking megabuildings, office blocks, bars, clubs, architectural &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wonders and dazzling neon 
                    signs - it's hard to believe that only a few decades ago the area looked like a smoldering battlefield in the 
                    aftermath of the 4th &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corporate War and the nuclear attack on Arasaka Tower. As anyone with a pair of optics can see, 
                    City Center was fully rebuilt, surpassing even its former &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;glory with more modern and cutting-edge architecture. 
                    It serves one purpose, and one purpose only - to flaunt the city's economic power and prove that &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night City is freer 
                    than ever before.
