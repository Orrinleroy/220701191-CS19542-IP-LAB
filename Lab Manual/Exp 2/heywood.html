                <p1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heywood is a district of contradictions. The northern part that 
                    borders the City Center is modern and well-kept, proud of its stunning megabuildings, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parks, and places 
                    that are open to the public. But all you have to is go a few blocks southeast and the scenery starts to change 
                    dramatically. This part of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heywood is much poorer and more dangerous. The buildings are smaller and the 
                    streets are controlled by the Valentinos and the 6th Street Gang. If you &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;know your place and keep your head down, 
                    Heywood isn't really so bad. After all, it's where most of Night City sleeps. If you're not a corpo and you &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;score 
                    an apartment in the richer part of the district, then you've just won the lottery. Otherwise, just be happy you live 
                    in Heywood. In Night City, things &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;could always be worse.
