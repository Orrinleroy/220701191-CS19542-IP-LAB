                <p1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Primarily inhabited by people of Japanese descent, Japantown during daytime is usually crowded with tourists 
                    for whom the many bars, fancy &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;restaurants, gaming parlors, the Cherry Blossom Market, 
                    and Shinto temple are mandatory destinations in Night City. Here one can also find the many &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clubs whose lights glow in 
                    thick abundance along Japantown's streets. Clean and safe by day, this district is a perfect spot 
                    for sightseeing, and it's just one &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bridge away from the famous Corpo Plaza, any one of whose many 
                    hotels are perfect places to stay. </p1>
