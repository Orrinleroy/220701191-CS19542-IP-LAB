                <p1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You could say that Pacifica is almost a microcosm of Night City's 
                    history. It started with, "We're building a paradise," and ended with "Dear God, what &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a nightmare." 
                    On paper it was meant to be the classiest and most iconic district catering to corporate employees - Night City's 
                    take on Las Vegas in its &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heyday. Luxury hotels, entertainment halls, sandy beaches... sadly, that Pacifica only 
                    existed in the blueprints drawn up by architects for fat-cat investors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those same investors pulled out 
                    every last enny after the Unification War broke out, fearing yet another inter-corporate conflict.
                    Pacifica was abandoned &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by all but the local Haitian community, led by a gang of netrunners called the Voodoo Boys. 
                    The city has repeatedly tried and failed to bring the district &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;back into the fold, but it remains isolated, 
                    with its own rules, language, manufactured goods (illegal in Night City) and independent Net. You could say 
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that Pacifica has blossomed under the Voodoo Boys' leadership, but poison oak would be a more suitable metaphor. 
                    To anyone who enters - beware.
