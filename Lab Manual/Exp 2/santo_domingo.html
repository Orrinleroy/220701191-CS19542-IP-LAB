                <p1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Santo Domingo is one of Night City's oldest districts. Luckily, its location 
                    meant it avoided the worst damage from the 4th Corporate War, though the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tens of thousands of Night 
                    Citizens deprived of their homes still built provisional camps and settlements. Today, no trace of 
                    them remains - Santo &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Domingo has instead become an industrial hub with an abundance of enterprises and 
                    manufacturing and power plants. Corporations are in constant battle &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over influence in the district - real 
                    estate changes hands, new businesses pop up and old businesses fall. Meanwhile, construction sites are 
                    guarded by &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;combat troops guarding corporate property and secrets, though often they serve as law enforcement 
                    in cases when a company shuts down and fires all its &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;staff (mostly around Rancho Coronado), raising 
                    the risk of riots. </p1>
